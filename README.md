# Key Insights from the Data:

## Conversion Rates:

- The new site design positively impacted conversions across all devices, particularly on desktop and mobile.
- The highest conversion rates were seen in the days following the site launch, indicating that the redesign effectively engaged users.
  
## Browser Performance:

- The redesign significantly improved conversions on most desktop and mobile browsers, particularly during the launch week, except for a few outliers like Chrome and Safari on desktop.
- For mobile and tablet, browsers like Android Webview and Edge saw substantial improvements, while Safari and Firefox lagged slightly.
  
## Sales Boost:

- Average orders spiked in the week of the redesign launch, showing a 39% increase compared to the earlier part of March. This suggests that the redesign and associated marketing efforts were successful in driving user engagement and transactions.
  
## Funnel Drop-offs:
- While the initial steps in the funnel (from browsing to cart and cart to shipping) saw conversion increases, there were noticeable drop-offs from shipping to payment and payment to invoice. Addressing these steps could further improve the overall conversion rate.

## Bounce Rate and Pageviews:

- A decrease in bounce rates across most pages indicates higher user engagement post-launch. The increased unique pageviews suggest users were more actively exploring the site.
  
## Site Speed:

- The improvements in site speed, particularly on mobile devices, likely contributed to better user experiences and higher conversions. However, performance on a few browsers (e.g., Firefox and Safari on mobile) still lags and could be further optimized.


This report provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the new site design, with strong performance in conversions, user engagement, and site speed. However, addressing funnel drop-offs and browser-specific performance issues could further optimize results.
